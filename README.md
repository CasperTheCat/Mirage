# Mirage

An image tagging and sorting web application built on Node.JS and Svelte.

### Deploy
Mirage is built to deploy with docker-compose. You can run it via NPM, but I would advise Docker as the example compose file sets the wanted environment variables.

If you wish to run this project directly from the provided compose file, please update the passwords and session secrets before deploying.
